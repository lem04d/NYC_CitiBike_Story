# NYC CitiBike Ridership Analysis

# Overview of the statistical analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to use the CitiBike user data from New York City to present to key stakeholders that the same program in Des Moines will also be successful. I have created visual presentations of the data broken down by time, gender, and location to show the peak usage and who is using the CitiBikes.   

# Results:
Here is a link to the Tableau story that contains the below visualizations: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitiBikeworkbook/NYCCItiBikeStory?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Here is a breakdown of all users of Citibike by gender. You will notice 'male' is the gender provided by most of the users.

Here is an overview of how long the average user is checking out the bikes. You will notice that most trips are less than 20 minutes in length.

#This is another view of the length of time that the bikes are checked out broken down by gender. You will notice a similar pattern that most are using the bikes for 20 minutes or less but the users who identify themselves as 'male' will use the bikes slightly longer than the other genders.

#This is a heatmap showing that rush hour during the week is the most popular time for use of the bikes. Suggesting people like to use them for tranportation to/from work.

#This heatmap is like the one above, broken down by gender. Another visualization showing that male users are the most frequent. 


# Summary:
Based on the visualizations presented, you can see that CitiBikes are very popular as a method of transportation to and from work. By placing them strategically in workforce neighborhoods and areas with high concentration of office buildings, Des Moines could see a very successfull roll out of the Citibike program in their city.
